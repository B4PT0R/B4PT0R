Hello!

I'm Baptiste, I live in France.

I’m interested in abstract and applied math, machine learning, data science, LLMs and anything related to artificial intelligence.

Most of the repos you'll find here are about turning interactive python shells with web interfaces into AI assistants.

The main idea being that there isn't much  difference between an interactive console and an AI chatbot. Both have a notion of context and history, interpret prompts and respond with outputs/actions.

The idea of unifying the two concepts as one has some elegance I think, so I'm digging it.

Cheers!
