Hello!

I'm Baptiste, I live in France.

I'm a math-head and self-taught python coding enthusiast.

I’m interested in abstract and applied math, machine learning, data science, LLMs and anything related to python.

I'm currently working mostly on my Pandora project which is about integrating Streamlit's rich input/output capabilities and OpenAI latest GPT4 AI model to an interactive web-based python console.

I've been working on these solo on my free time, but I think these projects offer something innovative and could benefit greatly from community contributions as much as I'd like to get in touch with similarly minded people to share ideas and get to work together.

If you like what I do, and feel like I could bring something to your company, just know that I'm open to any job opportunity, anywhere in the world, as a python developer in the AI / Data Science field. (I currently work as an Excel VBA developer for a DIY store and it's quite underwhelming, to say the least! Please save me! XD)

Cheers!
